            Sprint velocity problem You have list of Projects

 In a sprint, you donâ€™t work on
 multiple projects.
 If you have completed one project, you can
 wait till the next sprint to start the next project.
 Find the lowest sprint velocity(integer value of effort per sprint ),
 that you can put for these projects to complete all of them on time.
